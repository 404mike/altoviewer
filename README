ALTO Viewer
-----------

This viewer was developed to give a visual representation of ALTO XML Files.
For more infromation on the ALTO XML standard, see the Library of Congress website: http://www.loc.gov/standards/alto/

Currently the code is just for others to read and reuse as they wish, however I will endevour to develop a usable viewer with added functionality as time goes on.

Page layers can be turned on and off by using the toggle buttons at the top of the page

Also image scaling can be applied to the image. This does nothing more than alter the height and width attributes of the XHTML img tag, and alters all co-ordinate data accordingly to the ratios set in the URL (0.3 on both axis in this example)
